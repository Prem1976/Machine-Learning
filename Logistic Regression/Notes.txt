arpu for 4069 cust's are zero for last 2 months
they are going to churn

4069 0s for the last 2 months
1354 0s for the last 3 months

its avg arpu for first 2 months must be > 70 percentile (317.309)

can we delete -ve rows under arpu?
Average revenue per user
post paid

can we call them +ve churn?

ok

understood




T-mobile runs through subscription i believe
subscription includes mobile cost in emi
-ve values could be due to not paying mobile emis
correct

4th month custome might have made up the mind to churn, so its very high

just to get away with the o/s

i quit airtel just like that, they couldn't file any case against me
i got away with it
because their billing was wrong in my ISD calls
i tried
